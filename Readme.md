# Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises and projects in Python. These exercises cover a range of topics, from basic programming concepts to more advanced AI and problem-solving tasks.

## List of Questions

1. **Basic Python Programs**
    - [Program to print the multiplication table for a given number.](Q01a.py)
    - [Program to check whether a given number is prime or not.](Q01b.py)
    - [Program to find the factorial of a given number.](Q01c.py)

2. **List Operations**
    - Exploring various list operations including nested lists, length, concatenation, membership testing, iteration, and indexing and slicing.
    - Demonstrating list methods like add, extend, and delete.

3. **Set Operations**
    - Writing programs to illustrate different set operations.

4. **Simple Chatbot**
    - Implementing a basic chatbot in Python.

5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal**
    - Writing a program to perform BFS traversal on a graph.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal**
    - Implementing DFS traversal on a graph.

7. **Water Jug Problem**
    - Writing a program to solve the classic water jug problem.

8. **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) Algorithm**
