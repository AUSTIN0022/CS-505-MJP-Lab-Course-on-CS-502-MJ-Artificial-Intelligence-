## 3. Illustrate Different Set Operations

## 4. Simple Chatbot

## 5. Breadth First Search Traversal

## 6. Depth First Search Traversal

## 7. Water Jug Problem

## 8. K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

## 9. Regression Algorithm

## 10. Random Forest Algorithm

## 11. Solving the Eight Queens Problem (Uninformed Search)

## 12. Arrangement of Objects in a Room (Informed Search)

Implement a system that performs the arrangement of some set of objects in a room. Assume that you have only 5 rectangular and 4 square-shaped objects. Use an A* approach for the placement of the objects in the room for efficient space utilization. Assume suitable heuristic, and dimensions of objects and rooms.

## 13. Learning Agent for a Lift (Intelligent Agent)

(a) The lift would halt at a particular floor based on the identity of the individual.

(b) There would be energy optimization through the elimination of redundant operations.

## 14. Solving the N Queens Puzzle using Forward Checking (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)

## 15. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Game Theory)
